## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I want to create an app that is a database of cat cafes in the tri-state area or possibly the united states if that's not enough of a challenge. I want it really user friendly with immpresive UX design and utilize my graphic design background to really sell the visuals. I want it to have the functionality of grubhub but for cat cafes.

I love the concept of cat cafes (you pay to sit with a bunch of adoptable cats) and feel like it would be fun to have them all in one place besides searching google.

### Features

User Login: Customers can create an account to login to the application to leave reviews. Each user will have a profile page
Search: Users will be able to search for cat cafes based on zip code or state. The user can also filter results by price point.
Cat Cafe Page: After search returns results, the user can click on the cat cafe and see a menu of things offered at the location, and customer reviews.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I want to successfully devote time to marrying my ability to design with coding. I was super bummed that the java final project was just purely functional when we live in a visual world. Yes the code was good, but I want to be able to create something that is UX designed and coded.
